This Mod is a Multiplayer mod made for death match.the game starts out 1v1, and anyone else that joins must 
wait in a queue. As players die more will be allows to enter. Originally this was supposed to be 1 vs. all
and a team game but I was not able to negate team damage.

-----------------------
----8 weapon Mods------
-----------------------
Gauntlet knocks target across map- designed to distance self in 1v all match
nail gun- when a direct hit it does DOT
rail gun- is now an Armor gun
hyperblaster - on contact does DMG projectile damage
grenade Launcher- After shooting a grenade right click for manual detonation
rocket launcher- Right click after a rocket is shot to teleport to it
shotgun- napalm damage
dmg- only does damager over time with its splash effect.

------------------------
----Spawn in Waves------
------------------------
Upon my faliure to get bots in multiplayer, I still wanted to use the concept of spawning enemies in waves.
I used the concept to instead spawn players in waves. Players will only spawn if the player with team_num=0
kills a player with team_num=1. If its the waiting players turn they will spawn. 

NOTE:game will always start 1v1.

-------------------------
----Random Buy Menu------
-------------------------
It only works when the server is restarted.  This will control what the players can and can not buy, it will
also be random for each individual player.
